## Introduction

**{ds.ConfigName}** offers a suite of UI elements, foundational guidelines, and established standards assisting teams in creating visually appealing product interfaces.

Here, you'll find instructions on how to implement our design guidelines and make the most of Figma tools.


## Learn design guidelines

These consistent visual styles and components ensure a unified experience throughout **{ds.ConfigBrand}**'s products.

- **[Foundations](/documentation/foundations)**: represent our essential visual styles. Discover ways to utilize color, spacing, iconography, and typography in your designs.
- **[Tokens](/documentation/tokens)** are the visual design atoms of the system, encapsulating aesthetics such as colors, fonts, and spacing. Delve into our design token resources to consistently apply these elements across your designs, ensuring coherence and fidelity to our brand.
- **[Components](/documentation/components)**: are repeatable UI elements tailored for particular interactions or requirements. Delve into our component documentation to find design guidance and visual illustrations.
- **[Content](/documentation/content)**: offers guidance on crafting error messages and other standard UI texts.

When designing, always keep in mind accessibility, the **{ds.ConfigBrand}** brand identity, and our fundamental design principles.
