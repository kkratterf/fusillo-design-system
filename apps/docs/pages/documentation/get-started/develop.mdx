# ðŸ¤– Develop

Set up your environment to use {ds.ConfigName} components, design tokens, and tools.


## Intro

**{ds.ConfigName}** offers a suite of UI elements, foundational guidelines, and established standards assisting teams in creating visually appealing product interfaces.

Here, you'll find instructions on how to implement our design system components and make the most of developer tools.

## Before you begin

The **{ds.ConfigName}** is implemented with React 18 and TypeScript. Make sure you have React and optionally TypeScript installed before you start.

Youâ€™ll also need a package manager like NPM or YARN. We use npm in our examples:

```node copy
npm install react@18.2 typescript@4.5
```
