# ðŸ”— Design Tokens

Design tokens are the single source of truth for naming, managing and preserving design decisions.

## What are design tokens?

Design tokens are essentially pairs of names and values that capture discrete design elements. These elements could range from colors and typography to spacing and animation timing.

For instance, a token might standardize a color used across multiple products, like `bg-brand`.

## Why use design tokens?

Design tokens allow for advanced features like global theming, responsive design, and user customization. They streamline the design-to-development workflow, ensuring a cohesive handover and simplifying decision-making.

As our visual language evolves, updates made to design tokens propagate across all products, eliminating the need to manually update hard-coded values. Plus, our automated tools make adopting and implementing tokens more efficient for both designers and developers.

Implementing our latest visual guidelines through tokens ensures consistency across our UI and facilitates future improvements.

## Design token names

Understanding token names is crucial for efficient use of the design system. Each part of a token's name provides insight into its application.  
Let's take as examples: 

`bg(1)-brand(2)`  
`bg(1)-brand(2)-hover(3)`

- **1 - Property**: The specific UI element it applies to, such as text, background, border, ecc.
- **2 - Modifier**: Information about the color roles. Not all tokens have modifiers, for example, `text` and `icon` for the default text and icon color.
- **3 - State**: Additional information about interaction states.

## Use design tokens

Our design system houses a comprehensive list of [available tokens](/documentation/tokens/), complete with descriptions and use cases.
