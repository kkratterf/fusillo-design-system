# 🫂 Content accessibility

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet

## Intro

We at Fusillo give you all the tools to create design products for everyone. That means all the people can use your product and feel welcome, understood and valued. 

Here’s how. 


## POUR principle

We follow the WCAG guidelines that are driven by four principles: 

- **[Perceivable](#perceivable)**
- **[Operable](#operable)**
- **[Understandable](#understandable)**
- **[Robust](#robust)**

### Perceivable
All users will be able to perceive the information presented in your design - with all of their senses. 

That means a large use of empathy. Also, keep in mind that people will read your content on screen - seems obvious, but sometimes it’s not. Timing, colors, size, spacing and a lot of other aspects are essential. 

Take care of each of them - some users can’t see or hear, have low vision or are color blind. All the people need to have access to your content 🧡

<div className="w-full grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 gap-x-6 gap-y-0">
#### Do's
#### Dont's
<Callout className="h-40" type="info" emoji="💚">
    Use captions and subtitles for videos.
</Callout>
<Callout style={{ margin: '0' }} type="error" emoji="💔">
    Don’t publish videos without context, subtitles or saying who is talking.
</Callout>
<Callout className="w-full mt-0!important" type="info" emoji="💚">
    Make sure your links are meaningful and precise, and stand out from the text - learn more about how to deal with links.
</Callout>
<Callout className="w-full mt-0!important" type="error" emoji="💔">
    Avoid generic links as click here.
</Callout>
<Callout className="w-full mt-0!important" type="info" emoji="💚">
    Keep in mind that font face, size and weight should be nice and readable.
</Callout>
<Callout className="w-full mt-0!important" type="error" emoji="💔">
    Avoid fonts that are cute but hard to read.
</Callout>
<Callout className="w-full mt-0!important" type="info" emoji="💚">
    Be careful with the emojis - they can add value but the sentence must be readable without them (example: “What a nice unicorn! 🦄”)
</Callout>
<Callout className="w-full mt-0!important" type="error" emoji="💔">
    Do not use an emoji in place of a word (example: “What a nice 🦄!”) 
</Callout>
</div>


### Operable

All users will be able to operate your interface: content must be meaningful and navigation must be simple. 
Keep in mind that the experience shouldn’t require too much effort and users should have enough time to read what you’re telling them. 
Use Fusillo components and follow these principles: 

- When you write your content, think about how much time a person would take to read it and match it with the timing on screen: is it enough?
- Consider splitting your content in different paragraphs, web pages or app screens in order to be more clear
- Make accessible forms: make sure labels are meaningful and they persist during the navigation inside the field, take extra care to error messages


### Understandable

Users need to understand and memorize your content easily. 
Focus people attention, keep it short and simple and, if you need to go deeper, use a meaningful information hierarchy. 

Follow Fusillo do’s and dont’s to design a fully understandable product. 

<div className="w-full grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 gap-x-6 gap-y-0">
#### Do's
#### Dont's
<Callout className="h-40" type="info" emoji="💚">
    Try to keep your sentences up to 20 words long.
</Callout>
<Callout style={{ margin: '0' }} type="error" emoji="💔">
    Do not write long sentences without using paragraphs, spacing, headers or bullet points. 
</Callout>
<Callout className="w-full mt-0!important" type="info" emoji="💚">
    Try to always read your content out loud: how does it sound? Good? Some users will hear it - and even those who will read it, they will appreciate your effort to make it more clear.
</Callout>
<Callout className="w-full mt-0!important" type="error" emoji="💔">
    Don’t presume that it doesn’t matter if the content is long, because people can skip it: put more effort so they can put none 
</Callout>
<Callout className="w-full mt-0!important" type="info" emoji="💚">
    Imagine that you’re writing for a kid, in terms of readability: WCAG guidelines suggest us to aim to lower secondary education level
</Callout>
<Callout className="w-full mt-0!important" type="error" emoji="💔">
