# ü´Ç Content accessibility



We at **{logo.ConfigBrand}** give you all the tools to create **design products for everyone**. That means all the people can use your product and feel welcome, understood and valued. Here‚Äôs how. 

## POUR principle

We follow the [WCAG guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-principles/#standards) that are driven by four principles: 

- **[Perceivable](#perceivable)**
- **[Operable](#operable)**
- **[Understandable](#understandable)**
- **[Robust](#robust)**

### Perceivable
All users will be able to **perceive the information** presented in your design - with all of their senses. 

That means a large use of **empathy**. Also, keep in mind that people **will read your content on screen** - seems obvious, but sometimes it‚Äôs not. Timing, colors, size, spacing and a lot of other aspects are essential. 

Take care of each of them - some users can‚Äôt see or hear, have low vision or are color blind. **All the people need to have access to your content üß°**.

#### Examples
<div className="w-full grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 gap-x-6 gap-y-0">
<Callout type="info" emoji="üíö">
    **DO**  
    Use captions and subtitles for videos.
</Callout>
<Callout type="error" emoji="üíî">
    **DON'T**  
    Don‚Äôt publish videos without context, subtitles or saying who is talking.
</Callout>
<Callout type="info" emoji="üíö">
    **DO**  
    Make sure your [links are meaningful and precise](), and stand out from the text.
</Callout>
<Callout type="error" emoji="üíî">
    **DON'T**  
    Avoid generic links as [click here]().
</Callout>
<Callout type="info" emoji="üíö">
    **DO**  
    Keep in mind that **font face, size and weight** should be nice and readable.
</Callout>
<Callout type="error" emoji="üíî">
    **DON'T**  
    Avoid fonts that are cute but hard to read.
</Callout>
<Callout type="info" emoji="üíö">
    **DO**  
    **Be careful with the emojis** - they can add value but the sentence must be readable without them (example: ‚ÄúWhat a nice unicorn! ü¶Ñ‚Äù).
</Callout>
<Callout type="error" emoji="üíî">
    **DON'T**  
    Do not use an emoji in place of a word (example: ‚ÄúWhat a nice ü¶Ñ!‚Äù).
</Callout>
</div>


### Operable

All users will be able to **operate your interface**: content must be meaningful and navigation must be simple. 
Keep in mind that the experience shouldn‚Äôt require too much effort and users should have **enough time to read** what you‚Äôre telling them. 
Use {logo.ConfigName} components and follow these principles: 

- When you write your content, think about **how much time a person would take to read it** and match it with the timing on screen: is it enough?
- Consider **splitting your content** in different paragraphs, web pages or app screens in order to be more clear
- **Make accessible forms**: make sure labels are meaningful and they persist during the navigation inside the field, take extra care to [error messages]()


### Understandable

Users need to **understand and memorize your content** easily. 
Focus people attention, keep it short and simple and, if you need to go deeper, use a meaningful **information hierarchy**. 

Follow **{logo.ConfigBrand}** do‚Äôs and dont‚Äôs to design a fully understandable product. 

#### Examples
<div className="w-full grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 gap-x-6 gap-y-0">
<Callout type="info" emoji="üíö">
    **DO**  
    Try to keep your sentences up to **20 words** long.
</Callout>
<Callout type="error" emoji="üíî">
    **DON'T**  
    Do not write long sentences without using paragraphs, spacing, headers or bullet points. 
</Callout>
<Callout type="info" emoji="üíö">
    **DO**  
    Try to always **read your content out loud**: how does it sound? Good? Some users will hear it - and even those who will read it, they will appreciate your effort to make it more clear.
</Callout>
<Callout type="error" emoji="üíî">
    **DON'T**  
    Don‚Äôt presume that it doesn‚Äôt matter if the content is long, because people can skip it: put more effort so they can put none.
</Callout>
<Callout type="info" emoji="üíö">
   **DO**  
   **Imagine that you‚Äôre writing for a kid**, in terms of readability: [WCAG guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/reading-level.html) suggest us to aim to lower secondary education level - our [readability guideline](#readability) show you how.
</Callout>
<Callout type="error" emoji="üíî">
    **DON'T**  
    Avoid complex words and chose simpler ones when possible.
</Callout>
</div>


### Robust

Make **your content suitable for all devices and assistive technologies**: users and technologies keep evolving but your content needs to remain accessible. 

Test your product to see if every aspect of your content is good for different browsers, devices and if it‚Äôs good to be read by assistive technologies. 


## Readability

We at **{logo.ConfigBrand}** help you write **compelling yet simple and accessible content**. 
Keep these two goals in mind. Readability plays a huge role. Your content should be accessible to people from 9 to 15 years old. And it‚Äôs **good for everyone**: 

- It‚Äôs easier to understand by non-native speakers
- It‚Äôs easier to be heard by people who need assistive technologies
- It‚Äôs easier for neurodivergent people
- It‚Äôs easier for people in a rush, on the bus, tired and so on 

Let‚Äôs do it, then. 


### Keep it short
**Short sentences** are good for all devices: remember that users are ***screen readers***. 

Moreover, let‚Äôs consider: 
- **Personal conditions**
- **External context** (space and time, such as being outdoor, on the bus, with other people around, or in a rush) 
- **Different states of mind** (curious, anxious, worried, impatient‚Ä¶) 

#### Best practices
We need our content to be **short and sweet**. 

##### Up to 20 words
Keep your sentences **up to 20 words**
<div className="w-full grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 gap-x-6 gap-y-0">
<Callout type="info" emoji="üíö">
    **DO**  
    We‚Äôve being doing this for 20 years so we are trained to be your assistants. (15 words)
</Callout>
<Callout type="error" emoji="üíî">
    **DON'T**  
    Our deep experience of the complex and diverse maket has granted us to be the best player in town to offer our clients the best assistance they need. (28 words)
</Callout>
</div>

##### Shorter synonym
When in doubt, **chose a shorter synonym**
<div className="w-full grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 gap-x-6 gap-y-0">
<Callout type="info" emoji="üíö">
    **DO**  
    Use
</Callout>
<Callout type="error" emoji="üíî">
    **DON'T**  
    Utilize
</Callout>
</div>

##### Unnecessary words
**Avoid unnecessary words** and be careful with **prepositions**
<div className="w-full grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 gap-x-6 gap-y-0">
<Callout type="info" emoji="üíö">
    **DO**  
    Now
</Callout>
<Callout type="error" emoji="üíî">
    **DON'T**  
    At the moment
</Callout>
<Callout type="info" emoji="üíö">
    **DO**  
    We offer you an experience
</Callout>
<Callout type="error" emoji="üíî">
    **DON'T**  
    We intend to offer you an experience
</Callout>
</div>


##### Concrete and precise
Be **concrete and precise**, avoid vague expressions: people are more and more surrounded by **‚Äúempty words‚Äù** and do not pay attention
<div className="w-full grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 gap-x-6 gap-y-0">
<Callout type="info" emoji="üíö">
    **DO**  
    Our product is 100% organic cotton and has a three-year warranty.
</Callout>
<Callout type="error" emoji="üíî">
    **DON'T**  
    Our product is innovative, competitive, efficient, unique, reliable and has extraordinary features. 
</Callout>
</div>


### Use plain language
Plain language is the **shortest, most accurate and efficient way** to pass information. 
That means choosing the information that users need and putting it in the right way. 

That‚Äôs **ordinary language**, very close to the spoken language, and it‚Äôs not unprofessional writing.

#### Best practices
Users need to feel understood and guided. Your content must do that. 

##### Don‚Äôt be robotic
**Don‚Äôt be robotic**: your content speaks as a human being
<div className="w-full grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 gap-x-6 gap-y-0">
<Callout type="info" emoji="üíö">
    **DO**  
    Something went wrong
</Callout>
<Callout type="error" emoji="üíî">
    **DON'T**  
    Error detected
</Callout>
</div>

##### Active verbs
**Use active verbs** and keep it conversational: active voice makes it clear who needs to do what and leave no ambiguity about who is responsible for an action.
<div className="w-full grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 gap-x-6 gap-y-0">
<Callout type="info" emoji="üíö">
    **DO**  
    Create a new password
</Callout>
<Callout type="error" emoji="üíî">
    **DON'T**  
    A new password is required
</Callout>
<Callout type="info" emoji="üíö">
    **DO**  
    Pay now
</Callout>
<Callout type="error" emoji="üíî">
    **DON'T**  
    Payment needed
</Callout>
</div>

##### Sentence case
**Write in sentence case**. Use capital letters only for proper nouns and for the first word. That makes your content scannable and easier to read
<div className="w-full grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 gap-x-6 gap-y-0">
<Callout type="info" emoji="üíö">
    **DO**  
    Fill the form
</Callout>
<Callout type="error" emoji="üíî">
    **DON'T**  
    Fill the Form
</Callout>
<Callout type="info" emoji="üíö">
    **DO**  
    How to reach new clients
</Callout>
<Callout type="error" emoji="üíî">
    **DON'T**  
    How to reach New Clients
</Callout>
</div>

##### Simple words
Always prefer simple words (they‚Äôre quite often the shorter ones too)
<div className="w-full grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 gap-x-6 gap-y-0">
<Callout type="info" emoji="üíö">
    **DO**  
    Help
</Callout>
<Callout type="error" emoji="üíî">
    **DON'T**  
    Assistance
</Callout>
<Callout type="info" emoji="üíö">
    **DO**  
    Need
</Callout>
<Callout type="error" emoji="üíî">
    **DON'T**  
    Necessitate
</Callout>
<Callout type="info" emoji="üíö">
    **DO**  
    Before
</Callout>
<Callout type="error" emoji="üíî">
    **DON'T**  
    Previously
</Callout>
</div>

##### Nominalizations
**Avoid nominalizations** (verbs that becomes nouns)
<div className="w-full grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 gap-x-6 gap-y-0">
<Callout type="info" emoji="üíö">
    **DO**  
    To finalize your account
</Callout>
<Callout type="error" emoji="üíî">
     **DON'T**  
     In order to proceed with the finalization of your account
</Callout>
<Callout type="info" emoji="üíö">
    **DO**  
    Your must apply for this feature
</Callout>
<Callout type="error" emoji="üíî">
    **DON'T**  
    You must make an application for this feature
</Callout>
</div>
