# üìê Spacing

A spacing scale system simplifies the creation of page layouts and UI.

## 4 pixel base unit
Our spacing system is built around a base unit of 4 pixels. This base unit determines the spacing scale and ensures visual consistency across products.

## Scale
Building off of the 4px base unit, the main foundation of our spacing system is the spacing scale. This scale is a limited set of space values that can be used to lay out UI elements in a consistent way.

Each scale value is a multiple of the base unit and ranges from 0px to 384px to allow for flexibility while still maintaining consistency across different layouts.
