# 🪄 Design

Learn design guidelines and get access to Figma libraries and tools.

## Intro

Atlassian Design System is a collection of UI components, foundations, and standards that help teams build beautiful product experiences.

This page lists how to use our design guidelines and Figma tools. 

## Learn Atlassian’s design guidelines

These shared visual styles and components create harmonious experiences across Atlassian products.

- Foundations are our core visual styles. Learn how to apply color, elevation, spacing, iconography, and typography to your designs.
- Components are reusable UI elements designed for specific interactions or needs. Explore our component documentation for design usage guides and visual examples.
- Patterns show common flows and solutions composed from our foundations and components.
- Content has writing guidelines for error messages and other common UI copy.

Always design considering accessibility, the Atlassian brand, and our design principles. 


## Use Figma to apply the Atlassian Design System

Our Figma libraries and tools include our foundational styles, design tokens, components, and other helpers.

- Atlassians, install our private Figma libraries.
- Access public design system Figma resources in the Atlassian Figma Community.
- Use Atlassian design tokens Figma plugin to apply design tokens faster than Figma's native style panel.

  **We’re rolling out design tokens across Atlassian.**
  With design tokens, your style choices align with system-level design decisions. Implementing tokens makes things like dark mode possible and scalable across Atlassian.
