Set up your environment to use {ds.ConfigName} components, design tokens, and tools.


## Intro

Atlassian Design System is a collection of UI components, foundations, and standards that help teams build beautiful product experiences.

This page lists how to use Atlassian's design system components and developer tools.


## Before you begin

The Atlassian Design System is implemented with React 16 and TypeScript. Make sure you have React and optionally TypeScript installed before you start.

You’ll also need a package manager like NPM. We use yarn in our examples:

```node copy
yarn add react@16.8 react-dom@16.8 typescript@4.5
```

Atlassian Design System packages are available on npm under the @atlaskit scope, along with other Atlassian platform components. 

You can view source code for our public packages in Bitbucket (Atlassians can view these in the private Atlassian Frontend repository).


## Set up your style environment

1. Copy the following into your terminal to install our dependencies: CSS reset, design tokens, and ESLint plugin.

```node copy
yarn add @atlaskit/css-reset @atlaskit/tokens
```

2. Import these stylesheets at the root of your application. These are required for our components to work as expected in light and dark mode (coming soon).

```tsx copy
import '@atlaskit/css-reset';
```

  **We’re rolling out design tokens across Atlassian.**
  With design tokens, your style choices align with system-level design decisions. Implementing tokens makes things like dark mode possible and scalable across Atlassian.
