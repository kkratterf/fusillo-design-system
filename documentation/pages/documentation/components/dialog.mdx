# ‚ùñ Dialog

A window overlaid on either the primary window or another dialog window, rendering the content underneath inert.


## Usage

The Dialog component, often referred to as a modal, is an overlay window that appears in front of app content to provide critical information or prompt the user to make a decision. 

These dialogs disable interaction with the underlying content until the overlay is dismissed, making them useful for focusing the user's attention on the task at hand.

### When to use
- **Critical information**: Use a Dialog to display important information that requires the user's immediate attention or action, such as error messages or warnings.
- **User decisions**: Employ Dialogs to interrupt workflows to request user decisions or confirmation before proceeding with an action, like deleting data or confirming a purchase.
- **Focused tasks**: Utilize Dialogs to create a focused environment for the user to perform a specific task without distractions, such as filling out a form or configuring settings.

Avoid using Dialogs for non-critical information that could be presented less intrusively. Do not overuse Dialogs, as they can be disruptive and frustrating if not used sparingly and appropriately.
