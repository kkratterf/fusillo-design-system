# ‚ùñ Toast

A succinct message that is displayed temporarily.


## Usage

The Toast component displays a brief, auto-expiring message to provide feedback to the user following an action. Unlike modal dialogs or persistent alerts, Toasts are non-blocking and do not require user interaction to dismiss. 

They are commonly used to confirm that an action has been completed successfully, to report a minor error, or to convey short, informative messages.

### When to use
- **Feedback after an action**: Utilize Toasts to confirm actions such as saving a form, sending a message, or copying data to the clipboard.
- **Transient information**: Use Toasts to display temporary information that does not require user action and is not critical to the task at hand.
- **Non-disruptive alerts**: Employ Toasts for alerts that need to be noticed but do not require immediate user attention, allowing users to continue their current task without interruption.
- **Status updates**: Toasts can be used to provide status updates on user-initiated processes, like uploading a file or syncing data.

Avoid using Toasts for critical errors or information that requires immediate action, as they may go unnoticed. Do not overload the user with too many Toasts at once, as this can lead to information overload and a poor user experience. Additionally, ensure that Toasts do not cover important interactive elements of the application.
