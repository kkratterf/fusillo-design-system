# ‚ùñ Card

Displays a card with header, content, and footer.


## Usage

The Card component is a versatile container used to group related pieces of information together within a distinct visual block. It usually consists of a header, content area, and footer. 

Cards are commonly used in interfaces to display information in a digestible format, making it easy for users to scan and interact with data, such as products, articles, or profiles.

### When to use
- **Content segmentation**: Use Cards to segment content into manageable chunks, making complex information easier to understand at a glance.
- **Interactive elements**: Employ Cards when the grouped information needs to be interactive, such as clickable entities that lead to detailed views.
- **Visual consistency**: Utilize Cards to create a uniform appearance for different pieces of content that belong to the same category, ensuring a cohesive look and feel.
- **Responsive layouts**: Cards can be easily rearranged to fit different screen sizes and layouts, making them ideal for responsive design.

Avoid using Cards to contain a single piece of information with no contextual relationship to other elements; simpler UI elements may suffice. Do not overload Cards with too much information or too many actions, as this can lead to a cluttered appearance and cognitive overload for users.
