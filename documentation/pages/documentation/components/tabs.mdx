# ❖ Tabs

A set of layered sections of content—known as tab panels—that are displayed one at a time.


## Usage

Tabs organize content across different screens, data sets, and other interactive elements into separate sections with layered navigation. It’s a way to allow users to peruse a set of tab panels one at a time. 

Each tab is typically associated with a pane of content and when a user selects a tab, the associated content or panel is displayed, while others remain hidden.

### When to use
- **Content Organization**: Use Tabs when you have multiple content areas that are related and of equal importance, which need to be displayed separately to avoid overwhelming the user.
- **Space-saving**: Employ Tabs as a means to save space on the page while still making all content easily accessible.
- **Sequential Information**: When content naturally flows from one subject to the next, Tabs can segment the information in a logical manner.
- **Feature or Data Segmentation**: Use Tabs to segregate different features, options, or datasets that users can navigate between without leaving the page.

Avoid using Tabs for unrelated content that doesn’t require a clear separation within the same context. Tabs should not be used for primary navigation within an application where a more persistent form of navigation is needed. Additionally, avoid using Tabs when the content within each tab panel is too vast or complex, as this can lead to a cumbersome user experience.
