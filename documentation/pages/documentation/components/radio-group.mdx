# ❖ Radio Group

A set of checkable buttons—known as radio buttons—where no more than one of the buttons can be checked at a time.


## Usage

The Radio Group component consists of a set of radio buttons from which a user can make a single selection. Each radio button represents an option, and selecting one automatically deselects any other selected option within the same group. 

This is ideal for presenting a list of mutually exclusive choices where the user must choose only one item.

### When to use
- **Exclusive choices**: Use a Radio Group when you need users to select a single option from a list of two or more mutually exclusive choices, such as selecting a shipping method.
- **Compact forms**: Employ Radio Groups in forms where space is limited and you want to present all available options directly without requiring additional user interaction to reveal them.
- **Clear options comparison**: Utilize Radio Groups to allow users to compare all available options side-by-side to make an informed decision.
- **Simplified interaction**: Radio Groups are useful for simplifying the interaction by allowing a choice with a single click or tap, without the need for a dropdown menu.

Avoid using Radio Groups when multiple selections are allowed; checkboxes would be more appropriate in that scenario. Also, refrain from using them for large numbers of options where a dropdown might be less overwhelming and more user-friendly. It's important not to crowd too many radio buttons close together to prevent misclicks and to ensure ease of use on touch devices.
