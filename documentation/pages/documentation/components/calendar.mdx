# ðŸ’  Calendar

An interactive calendar for date selection experiences.


## Usage

The Calendar component is an interactive UI element that allows users to view and select dates within a graphical layout representing days, weeks, and months. 

This component is often used to schedule events, book appointments, or input dates in forms.

### When to use
- **Date selection**: Use a Calendar when users need to select dates for tasks like booking, scheduling, or entering their date of birth.
- **Event planning**: Employ a Calendar for planning and managing events, allowing users to see an overview of their scheduled activities.
- **User-friendly interfaces**: Calendars can make the date selection process more user-friendly by providing a visual context, which is particularly useful in complex scheduling applications.

Avoid using a Calendar for simple date entry that can be handled with a basic input field. Don't rely on the Calendar as the sole date input method; offer a manual input option for users who prefer to type the date directly. Ensure that the Calendar does not become a barrier to completing tasks, especially for users with disabilities or those using devices with small screens.
