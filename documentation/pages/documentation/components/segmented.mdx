# ‚ùñ Segmented

Used to organize content by grouping similar information on the same area.

<Tabs items={['Preview', 'Code']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```js copy 
    
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

## Usage

The Segmented Control component allows users to choose between two or more mutually exclusive options. It is displayed as a horizontal set of segments, each representing an option, with the current selection highlighted. 

This component is often used to switch between different views, filters, or modes within the same context.

### When to use
- **Mode switching**: Use Segmented Controls for changing modes within a particular context, such as switching between list and grid views in a gallery.
- **Filtering content**: Employ Segmented Controls to filter content on a page, such as sorting items by price or date.

Avoid using Segmented Controls when the options represent a workflow or a process with sequential steps; in such cases, a stepper or progress indicator might be more appropriate.
