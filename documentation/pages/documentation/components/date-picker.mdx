# ðŸ’  Date Picker

A date time picker allows the user to select an associated date and time.


## Usage

The Date Picker component is an interface that allows users to select dates from a structured calendar view. 

It simplifies the process of inputting dates by providing a visual and interactive way to select a date, eliminating formatting errors and improving the accuracy of data entry.

### When to use
- **Form input**: Use a Date Picker in forms where users need to enter a date, such as for booking flights, making appointments, or setting reminders.
- **Data filtering**: Employ a Date Picker to enable users to filter data by date, such as in reports, logs, or activity feeds.
- **Event creation**: Utilize a Date Picker when users are scheduling events or setting deadlines to ensure they can select the correct date and time without error.
- **User convenience**: Offer a Date Picker to streamline data entry, minimizing the need for manual typing and reducing the likelihood of input errors.

Avoid using Date Pickers for date ranges that are better served by a simpler input method, like entering an age or year. Do not use a Date Picker if the exact date is not necessary, or when it could overcomplicate a simple task. Ensure that the Date Picker is not the only method of entering a date, as some users may prefer to type a date manually.
