# ‚ùñ Switch

A control that allows the user to toggle between checked and not checked.


## Usage

The Switch component is a control that offers a binary choice, such as on/off or yes/no. It's a visual toggle between two mutually exclusive states and is a common control in user interfaces for settings. 

Unlike checkboxes, which can be used for multiple selections, a Switch represents a one-or-the-other option and is typically used to activate or deactivate a specific feature or setting.

### When to use
- **Immediate action settings**: Use a Switch when the user's action should have an immediate effect, without the need for a "Submit" button. For example, toggling dark mode on or off.
- **Binary options**: Employ a Switch for settings that can only be either enabled or disabled, where no intermediate states are possible.
- **Space-saving**: A Switch is a good choice when space is at a premium, and you want to avoid cluttering the interface with larger controls like sliders or buttons.
- **Preference settings**: They are ideal for preference settings that a user might want to toggle frequently, such as turning Wi-Fi or Bluetooth on a mobile device on and off.

Avoid using a Switch when the action requires further confirmation or has significant consequences that the user might not fully understand from the toggle alone. Do not use a Switch for actions that require more granular control or for settings that need to be saved before taking effect.
